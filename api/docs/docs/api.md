## Documentation on the API

There are a couple aspects to the WevMEV REST API.  We have the actual API endpoints which are used to drive analysis or a frontend visualization.  Documentation of the API interaction is provided by auto-generated documentation conforming to the OpenAPI spec here: [API documentation](api_spec.html)  

Behind the API itself are the data structures and models that we use to architect the system.  You will find information about these entities and their relationships in this section.
